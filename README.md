# elements-practice
Quick practice activity for modifying, adding, and removing elements.


##Activity Instructions:
Follow along with the directions on the index.html page and modify the elements. This is the first
practice activity for the adding/modifying elements lesson. 

###Notes:
Do your best and make sure to change the elements with JavaScript instead of altering the index.html file.
If you finish early, go ahead and make your own project and show program staff!
